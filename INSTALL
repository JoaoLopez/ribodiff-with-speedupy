RiboDiff INSTALL
================

This document shows how to install RiboDiff on your computer. You can either install
it globally such that every user can use it, or you can install it to your own directory.

Before install RiboDiff, make sure the required packages are already installed on your 
computer. Please refer to README.md file for details regarding which packages are required.

For a global install (you need root permissions to do so), go to the package directory and
execute the following commands:

	python setup.py build
	python setup.py test (optional step)
	python setup.py install

Alternatively, for a local install, execute the following commands instead:

	python setup.py build
	python setup.py test (optional step)
	python setup.py install --prefix=/PATH/PREFIX

Please replace /PATH/PREFIX with your prefered path where RiboDiff will be installed. 
Make sure this path exists in your PATHONPATH environment variable. If not, you 
can edit PATHONPATH in your ~/.bashrc if you are using Linux or ~/.bash_profile if 
Mac OS X by adding the folowing line:

export PYTHONPATH=/PATH/PREFIX/lib/python2.7/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH

Then execute the command to finish installation:

	python setup.py install --prefix=/PATH/PREFIX
